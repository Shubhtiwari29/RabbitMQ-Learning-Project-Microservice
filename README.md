*RabbitMQ-Learning-Project-Microservice*

This repository contains a learning project focused on building microservices with Spring Boot 3 and RabbitMQ. 
The project was developed as part of the Spring Boot 3 + RabbitMQ Microservices certification course on Udemy.

Overview  :->
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to integrate RabbitMQ into a microservices architecture using Spring Boot.
It covers essential concepts such as message producers, consumers, queues, exchanges, and routing.

📖 Learning Objectives :->
1) Understand the fundamentals of RabbitMQ and message queues.
2) Learn how to set up and configure RabbitMQ in a Spring Boot project.
3) Implement message producers and consumers using RabbitMQ.
4) Explore advanced features like message acknowledgment, routing, and error handling.

🛠️ Features  :->
1) Spring Boot 3 for building microservices
2) RabbitMQ for message brokering
3) REST API endpoints for sending and receiving messages
4) JSON message format
5) Asynchronous communication between services
6) Docker support for containerized deployment
7) Error handling and retry mechanisms
8) Logging with SLF4J and Logback

Architecture :->
The project follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

1) Producer Service: Sends messages to a RabbitMQ exchange.
2) Consumer Service: Listens to the RabbitMQ queue and processes incoming messages.
3) RabbitMQ Broker: Manages message exchanges and queues.

🔗 Technologies Used :->
1) Java 17
2)Spring Boot 3
3) RabbitMQ
4) Maven for dependency management

💡 Key Takeaways :->
Event-driven architectures are essential for building scalable, resilient, and decoupled systems.
RabbitMQ is a powerful tool for asynchronous communication between microservices.
Hands-on projects help solidify theoretical knowledge and improve practical skills.
